Hello dear fellow developer and computer enthusiast. I introduce myself under the pseudonym, Goethegoat.

📚  I am a student in management and commerce with a specialization in computer science and this last discipline is the one that interests me the most. 


💻 I have an advanced level in WEB development (HTML, CSS, JS), so I am willing to help you in your projects. Also projects that use languages (SQL and VBA).
Then I have advanced knowledge in object and software development (Python, Java, C#).

🛡️ Besides that, I'm training on several languages and in cyber security (Kali Linux). 

📥 If you want to contact me, you can send me a mail at : yann.goetgheluck8@gmail.com
